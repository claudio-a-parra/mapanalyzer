# TEST: OVERLOAD SAME SET
# Request addresses that map to the same set. Just to easily identify each
# request, we are requesting 1, 2, 3 bytes and so on.

#   +--- bits 4-5 of the address (or 0-1 of 0x2 = 0010) determine the set
#   |    of the address. So keeping this hex digit in {2, 6, a, e} will
#   |    land in the same set.
